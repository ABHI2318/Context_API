# Context_API
ContextAPI for global access management

## About
ContextAPI:The Context API in React is a feature that allows you to share state between components without having to pass the state explicitly through props at every 
level of the component tree. This can be particularly useful for managing global or shared state in your application.

1. Create a React App (if not done already):

cd my-context-app

2 Run Your React App:
Start your development server to see the changes.
